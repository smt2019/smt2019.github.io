<h2>Scope and Topics of Interest</h2>

<h3>Background</h3>

<p>
Determining the satisfiability of first-order formulas modulo
background theories, known as the Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT)
problem, has proved to be an enabling technology for verification,
synthesis, test generation, compiler optimization, scheduling, and
other areas. The success of SMT techniques depends on the development
of both domain-specific decision procedures for each background theory
(e.g., linear arithmetic, the theory of arrays, or the theory of
bit-vectors) and combination methods that allow one to obtain more
versatile SMT tools, usually leveraging Boolean satisfiability (SAT)
solvers. These ingredients together make SMT techniques well-suited
for use in larger automated reasoning and verification efforts.</p>

<h3>Aims and Scope</h3>

<p>The aim of the workshop is to bring together researchers and users of
SMT tools and techniques. Relevant topics include but are not limited
to:</p>
<ul>
<li> Decision procedures and theories of interest</li>
<li> Combinations of decision procedures</li>
<li> Novel implementation techniques</li>
<li> Benchmarks and evaluation methodologies</li>
<li> Applications and case studies</li>
<li> Theoretical results</li>
</ul>

<p>Papers on pragmatic aspects of implementing and using SMT tools, as
well as novel applications of SMT, are especially encouraged.</p>
