<h2 class="title"><b>Call For Papers</b></h2>

<h3> Background</h3>

<p>
Determining the satisfiability of first-order formulas modulo
background theories, known as the Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT)
problem, has proved to be an enabling technology for verification,
synthesis, test generation, compiler optimization, scheduling, and
other areas. The success of SMT techniques depends on the development
of both domain-specific decision procedures for each background theory
(e.g., linear arithmetic, the theory of arrays, or the theory of
bit-vectors) and combination methods that allow one to obtain more
versatile SMT tools. These ingredients together make SMT techniques
well-suited for use in larger automated reasoning and verification
efforts.
</p>

<h3>Aims and Scope</h3>

<p>
The aim of the workshop is to bring together researchers and users of
SMT tools and techniques. Relevant topics include but are not limited
to:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Decision procedures and theories of interest</li>
<li> Combinations of decision procedures</li>
<li> Novel implementation techniques</li>
<li> Applications and case studies</li>
<li> Benchmarks and evaluation methodologies</li>
<li> Theoretical results</li>
</ul>

<p>
Papers on pragmatic aspects of implementing and using SMT tools, as
well as novel applications of SMT, in particular in the areas of machine
learning and statistical reasoning, are especially encouraged.
</p>

<h3>Paper submission and Proceedings</h3>

<p>
  Three categories of submissions are invited:
</p>
<ul>
<li> <strong>Extended abstracts</strong>: given the informal style of the workshop, we
strongly encourage the submission of preliminary reports of work in
progress. They may range in length from very short (a couple of pages)
to the full 10 pages and they will be judged based on the expected
level of interest for the SMT community. They will be included in the
informal proceedings.</li>

<li> <strong>Original papers</strong>: contain original research (simultaneous submissions
are not allowed) and sufficient detail to assess the merits and
relevance of the submission. For papers reporting experimental results,
authors are strongly encouraged to make their data available. </li>

<li> <strong>Presentation-only papers</strong>: describe work recently published or
submitted and will not be included in the proceedings. We see this as a
way to provide additional access to important developments that SMT
  Workshop attendees may be unaware of.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Papers in all three categories will be peer-reviewed. Extended
  abstracts and original papers should not exceed 10 pages and should
  be in standard-conforming PDF. Technical details may be included in
  an appendix to be read at the reviewers' discretion. Final versions
  should be prepared in LaTeX using
  the <a href="https://easychair.org/publications/easychair.zip">easychair.cls</a>
  class file. (The 10 page limit does not need to count references.)
</p>
<p>
  Presentation-only papers should be in a PDF, but can be copies of
  existing published research.  They do not need to conform to the class
  file or 10-page limit.
</p>

<p>
  To submit an abstract or paper, go to the
  <a href="http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=smt2019">EasyChair
    conference page</a> and follow the instructions.
