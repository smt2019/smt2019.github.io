<h3 id="rsebastiani">SMT-Based Weighted Model Integration</h3>
<div style="font-size: 1.4em; font-weight: bold;">Roberto Sebastiani (<a href="http://disi.unitn.it/rseba/">University of Trento, Italy</a>)</div>
<p>
  <b>Abstract:</b> Weighted Model Integration (WMI) is a recent
  formalism generalizing Weighted Model Counting (WMC) to run
  probabilistic inference over hybrid domains, characterized by both
  discrete and continuous variables and relationships between
  them. WMI is computationally very demanding.
</p>

<p>
In this talk I will introduce WMI and its usage. Then I'll present our
theoretical framework and algorithms for WMI, which allow to exploit
the power of SMT-based AllSMT and SMT-based predicate-abstraction
techniques in designing efficient inference procedures. Experimental
results on synthetic and real-world data show drastic computational
improvements over the original WMI formulation as well as existing
alternatives for hybrid inference. I conclude by describing recent
developments, plus ongoing and future work.

<h3 id="nbjorner">Programming Z3</h3>
<div style="font-size: 1.4em; font-weight: bold;">Nikolaj Bj&oslash;rner (<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/nbjorner/">Microsoft Research</a>)</div>
<p>
<b>Abstract:</b> We give a programmer's introduction to the
Satisfiability Modulo Theories Solver Z3. With the python scripting
interface as starting point we describe ways to interact with Z3 and
selected algorithms underlying the decision procedures. We present a
set of case studies to cover some of the main available features while
uncovering some of the internals.
