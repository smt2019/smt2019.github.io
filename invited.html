<p>
<b>Abstract:</b> We give a programmer's introduction to the
Satisfiability Modulo Theories Solver Z3. With the python scripting
interface as starting point we describe ways to interact with Z3 and
selected algorithms underlying the decision procedures. We present a
set of case studies to cover some of the main available features while
uncovering some of the internals.

<b>Bio:</b> Nikolaj Bjorner is a Principal Researcher at Microsoft
  Research, Redmond, working in the area of Automated Theorem Proving
  and Software Engineering. His work includes the state-of-the art
  theorem prover Z3, which is used as a foundation of several software
  engineering tools. It also includes verifying networks at hyperscale
  in the Azure cloud infrastructure. Z3 received the 2015 ACM SIGPLAN
  Software System award and most influential tool paper in the first
  20 years of TACAS in 2014, and test of time award at ETAPS
  2018. Previously, he developed the DFSR, Distributed File System -
  Replication, and Remote Differential Compression protocols, RDC,
  part of Windows Server since 2005 and before that worked on
  distributed file sharing systems at a startup, and program synthesis
  and transformation systems at the Kestrel Institute. He received his
  Master’s and Ph.D. degrees in computer science from Stanford
  University, and spent the first few years of university at DTU and
  DIKU.
